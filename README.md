Weather App 🌤️
A Flutter-based weather application that fetches weather data from an API for a specified city and provides local storage to store the weather data of recent cities.




Features

💾 Local Storage: The app stores weather information for recent cities locally so that users can quickly check the previously searched locations even when offline.

//🧭 Geolocation Support: The app can fetch the user's current location and display the weather for that city (optional).
📅 7-Day Forecast: Displays a 7-day weather forecast for the selected city.
🔍 Recent Search History: View and access previously searched cities stored locally.
